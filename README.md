## ⚡ Quick Start

*Prerequisites*  
- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- A Supabase account

1. *Clone the Repository*
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-golf.git
cd web-golf


2. *Install Dependencies*
bash
npm install


3. *Set Up Environment Variables*
Create a .env.local file in the root of your project and add your Supabase project credentials.
.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key


4. *Set Up Supabase Database*
Run the following SQL script in your Supabase project's SQL Editor to create the necessary tables and functions.
sql
-- Create the scores table
CREATE TABLE scores (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  level_id INT NOT NULL,
  strokes INT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE (user_id, level_id)
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE scores ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for users to view their own scores
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to view their own scores"
ON scores FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create policy for users to insert/update their scores
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to insert/update their own scores"
ON scores FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Allow users to update their own scores"
ON scores FOR UPDATE
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Create the database function to update scores
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_score(level_id_in INT, strokes_in INT)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.scores (user_id, level_id, strokes)
  VALUES (auth.uid(), level_id_in, strokes_in)
  ON CONFLICT (user_id, level_id)
  DO UPDATE SET
    strokes = LEAST(scores.strokes, strokes_in);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


5. *Run the Development Server*
bash
npm run dev

The application will be available at http://localhost:9002.

## 🎮 How to Play

### Objective
The goal is simple: get the ball into the hole in as few strokes as possible. Try to beat the 'Par' for each course!

### Desktop Controls
- *Aim & Shoot: **Left-click and drag* away from the ball to aim. The direction and distance determine the aim and power. *Release* to shoot.
- *Camera Orbit: **Right-click and drag* to orbit the camera around the current view.
- *Camera Pan: **Left-click and drag* to pan the camera across the scene.
- *Camera Zoom: Use the **mouse scroll wheel* to zoom in and out.

### Mobile Controls
- *Aim & Shoot: **Tap and drag* on the screen to aim and set power. *Release* your finger to shoot.
- *Camera Orbit: Use a **one-finger drag* to orbit the camera.
- *Camera Zoom/Pan: Use standard **two-finger pinch and drag* gestures to zoom and pan the camera.
