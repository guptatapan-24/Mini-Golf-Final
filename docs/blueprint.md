# **App Name**: Web Golf

## Core Features:

- Scene Rendering: Initialize a Three.js scene with camera, lighting, and a 3D golf hole model.
- Ball Interaction: Allow the user to aim and apply power to the golf ball to move it around the course.
- Physics Simulation: Implement basic physics for ball movement including friction to slow the ball down.
- Game State Management: Track the game state including the current hole, the par for the hole, and the player's stroke count.
- Goal Detection: Detect when the golf ball enters the hole to complete the level.
- Camera Control: Enable interactive camera controls (orbit, pan, zoom) for course inspection.
- Course Design Tooling: A tool for programmatically or graphically editing and tuning different aspects of course design such as launch point or obstacles; tuned using a generative AI to search the design space efficiently.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant green (#7CFC00) to evoke the fresh, manicured turf of a golf course.
- Background color: Soft light gray (#D3D3D3), subtly reminiscent of fog and clouds in the sky above a golf course.
- Accent color: Muted gold (#B8860B) to represent the ultimate goal.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its readability and clean design, creating a modern user interface.
- Simple, flat icons to represent different game actions and feedback. Focus on clarity.
- Clean, modern layout with an intuitive placement of controls and feedback elements.
- Subtle animations and transitions to provide clear feedback during ball movement and level transitions.
